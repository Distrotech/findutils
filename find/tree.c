/* Optimize the ordering of the predicates in the tree.  Rearrange
   them to minimize work.  Strategies:
   * Evaluate predicates that don't need inode information first;
     the predicates are divided into 1 or more groups separated by
     predicates (if any) which have "side effects", such as printing.
     The grouping implements the partial ordering on predicates which
     those with side effects impose.

   * Place -name, -iname, -path, -ipath, -regex and -iregex at the front
     of a group, with -name, -iname, -path and -ipath ahead of
     -regex and -iregex.  Predicates which are moved to the front
     of a group by definition do not have side effects.  Both
     -regex and -iregex both use pred_regex.

     This routine "normalizes" the predicate tree by ensuring that
     all expression predicates have AND (or OR or COMMA) parent nodes
     which are linked along the left edge of the expression tree.
     This makes manipulation of subtrees easier.
